Locate and open the class documentation for the String class.

Answer:
On the main page of the documentation, we can either search for the String class under "Class and Module" index menu on the left, or we can use the search boc at the top to search for the String class.

On the String class documentation page, the most important part is the methods.
Class methods are denoted by "::" and instance methods are denoted by "#" characters.

For example, String::new is a class methoed, whereas String#upcase is an instance method. These notations are for documentation purposes only.
